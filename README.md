# turing
A tool for simulating arbitrary Turing Machines written in Python 3.

2015-12-02: Currently, the design is such that it is best used for educational
purposes. Arbitrary Turing Machines and their inputs can be specified
by their seven parameters via text files in conjunction with the
examples included. Turing Machines and their inputs can also be
created and computed via Python codes, such that if one wanted to
design a program to use the TuringMachine definition, one could do so
without too much difficulty.
